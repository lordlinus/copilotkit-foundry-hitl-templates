**Build a complete CopilotKit + AG-UI + Azure AI Foundry hosted-agent app — with human-in-the-loop approval that actually re-executes server-side.**

A template gallery for agentic apps on the **Microsoft Agent Framework + CopilotKit + Azure AI Foundry** stack.

## What is this?

forgewright is a **template gallery + agent skill**. Point a coding agent
(GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, …) at this repo and ask for an app:

> *"Build me an assistant that can look up an order and issue a refund, but make
> the refund require my approval first."*

The agent reads `AGENTS.md` → loads `.agents/skills/forgewright/SKILL.md` →
scaffolds the canonical template → customizes the agent's tools and the chat UI →
and proves it with `make verify` + `make smoke` (the bridge against the REAL agent
run locally via `azd ai agent run`). You get a
**Next.js + CopilotKit v2** UI over an **AG-UI bridge** to an **Azure AI Foundry
HOSTED agent** that runs all tools, history, and **human-in-the-loop approval**
server-side — plus `azd` to deploy the hosted agent.

## Architecture

```
 Browser — Next.js + CopilotKit v2            Foundry HOSTED agent = the BRAIN
   useAgent / useRenderTool /                   build_hosted_agent(): FoundryChatClient
   useHumanInTheLoop                            ALL @tools + HITL + history (server-side)
   route.ts (CopilotSseRuntime + HttpAgent)            ▲ Responses (stream) +
        │  AG-UI / SSE                                 │ mcp_approval_response
        ▼                                              │
   BRIDGE  (backend/bridge_app.py)                     │
     HostedProxyAgent → forwards each turn, translates Responses → AG-UI
     (text, tool cards, confirm_changes), and forwards the HITL decision so
     the gated tool RE-EXECUTES server-side. Local dev: `azd ai agent run` runs
     the SAME agent on your machine; the bridge points at it (DIRECT mode) — no mock.
```

**Why a bridge? (and why it's the *minimum*)** You can't point a CopilotKit/AG-UI
client at a deployed Foundry hosted agent — its endpoint speaks the OpenAI
**Responses** protocol, not AG-UI. We tested the framework's native path
(`add_agent_framework_fastapi_endpoint(FoundryAgent(...))`) against a real hosted
agent on the latest packages (agent-framework 1.9 / ag-ui rc5). It does a lot —
streams text, renders tool cards, even *surfaces* the approval request — but it
**cannot complete HITL**: on approve it never sends `mcp_approval_response` to the
hosted agent (the client doesn't model that Responses item), so the gated tool
never re-runs (state unchanged — verified). The bridge fills exactly that gap and
nothing more: a thin forwarder (`HostedProxyAgent` + `hosted_client`) that calls
the hosted-agent endpoint and forwards `mcp_approval_response`, plus two small
ag-ui patches (HITL routing + multi-tool snapshot split) that `make smoke`
proves are load-bearing. See `references/architecture.md` for the full test matrix.

## Quick start

```bash
# Scaffold a runnable app from the canonical template:
scripts/new-app.sh my-app ~/projects

cd ~/projects/my-app
make verify      # structural checks (no network)
make smoke       # end-to-end HITL — read works, action PAUSES, approve executes,
                 # reject doesn't. Runs the REAL agent locally via `azd ai agent run`
                 # (needs `az login` + a provisioned project — see `make up`)
make local       # dev loop: REAL agent (azd ai agent run) + bridge :8080 + frontend :3000
make up          # azd → deploy the Foundry hosted agent
```

Then edit `src/agent.py` (tools + instructions) and `frontend/components/` (v2
render cards). Keep the bridge, `build_hosted_agent()`, and the HITL contract as
shipped — see `.agents/skills/forgewright/SKILL.md`.

## Why these choices (validated live)

- **Foundry hosted agent uses `FoundryChatClient` (Responses).** This is what
  makes HITL approve **re-execute** the gated tool server-side
  (`mcp_approval_request` → `mcp_approval_response`). Verified live end-to-end
  (approve mutates state; reject doesn't).
- **The bridge forwards the approval.** The native
  `add_agent_framework_fastapi_endpoint(FoundryAgent(…))` path can't — it resolves
  `confirm_changes` locally. `HostedProxyAgent` routes the
  decision to the hosted agent.
- **Same agent locally and deployed.** `azd ai agent run` runs the REAL hosted
  agent (`FoundryChatClient`, Responses) on your machine, connected to your Foundry
  project's model; `make smoke` points the bridge at it (DIRECT mode), so the whole
  SSE + HITL path is exercised against the real agent — no mock.
- **CopilotKit v2** hooks (`useAgent`, `useRenderTool`, `useHumanInTheLoop`) for
  chat, tool-render cards, and the approval gate.

## Live showcase

[`showcase/`](showcase/) is a self-contained **portfolio demo**: a static gallery
(GitHub Pages) that talks over **AG-UI/SSE** to an always-on Container App
fronting the template agents — *Try it* to chat in your browser, *View source* to
land on the template here. See [`showcase/README.md`](showcase/README.md).

## Templates

<!-- TEMPLATES:START -->
| Template | Description | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Agentic CopilotKit + Foundry (HITL)](templates/agentic-copilot-foundry)** | A Next.js/CopilotKit chat UI over a FastAPI/AG-UI SSE backend hosting one Microsoft Agent Framework agent, connected keyless to Azure AI Foundry, with native human-in-the-loop approval on consequential tools.

| **[Conversational Banking (HITL)](templates/conversational-banking)** | A conversational banking assistant: check balances and recent activity freely, but every money movement (transfer, bill pay) pauses on an Approve/Reject widget before it executes. CopilotKit + AG-UI over one Microsoft Agent Framework agent, keyless to Azure AI Foundry; also publishable as a Foundry hosted agent via azd. | Next.js, CopilotKit, AG-UI, Microsoft Agent Framework, Azure AI Foundry |
| **[Health Insurance Claim Intake (HITL)](templates/health-claim-intake)** | Intake multiple claim documents, auto-fill the claim form, let the user review and edit, then submit to the insurer behind a human-in-the-loop approval gate. CopilotKit + AG-UI over one Microsoft Agent Framework agent, keyless to Azure AI Foundry; also publishable as a Foundry hosted agent via azd. | Next.js, CopilotKit, AG-UI, Microsoft Agent Framework, Azure AI Foundry |

## Make targets (gallery)

```text
make new-app NAME=x [DIR=.]        scaffold a runnable app from the canonical template
make new-template NAME=x ...       add a new template variant to the gallery
make manifest                      regenerate forgewright-template.yml + README table
make check                         verify generated manifests are in sync
make list                          list templates
make verify-template               run the canonical template's structural checks
```

## How it's proven

- `make verify` — structural: the bridge mounts `HostedProxyAgent`, forwards
  `mcp_approval_response`, `build_hosted_agent` uses `FoundryChatClient`, names are
  consistent, MCR base images.
- `make smoke` — end-to-end against the REAL agent run locally via `azd ai agent
  run`: read works, the consequential prompt PAUSES, approve executes, reject doesn't,
  snapshot/replay OK.
- **Live** — deploy with `azd`, run the bridge against the hosted agent, and confirm
  HITL approve re-executes (state changes) and reject doesn't, in a real browser.
